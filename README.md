# Swedish Auto Insurance
This is a very simple dataset that has just two columns: 
- one is the number of claims made, and
- the next is the payment made in thousands of Kronor for that claims.

Since this has just two variables - one independent, and one dependent - and both continuous, it would make sense to get started with building some Regression Models on the same. This repository hosts the approach on this dataset using - Simple Linear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares Regression) Model :)
